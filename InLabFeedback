AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT:
Needs more content, pages need to be more complete. Margins need to be flused. Front page requires more content, in a sort of image to large, tiny bit of scroll state.

Hide nav, show all the content for the account page if javaScript doesn't work.

Form fields should be more managable
We need the whole quiz

Fix issues with mobile, nav should use flex

DEVICE VIEW
apple device landscape
- sub nav overflows, horizontal scroll
samsung device portrait
- nav is wonky
- stack subscription options
- viewport needs to be changed on FAQ

DISCUSSION:

/USABILITY
Our content was generally good, however a few specific changes can be made. In particular, the answer in one of or FAQ questions is too long, and should either be broken up into multiple questions, or made more concise. Another comment that was made was about the similarity between the h1s and h2s on certain pages, but that the font type and weights might be different enough to leave as is. Lastly, the line colours on the subscription page were overwhelming and can be toned down.

/FINDABILITY
The account view needs to have clearer
