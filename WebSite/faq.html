							<p> A kitchen catcher is a counter-top (or under-sink) container with a lid that you use in your kitchen that can be carried to and from the communal food scraps recycling bins and easily cleaned. Many stores sell them, or residents can make their own (a lidded coffee tin, a large yogurt container, or a glass bowl with a plate top). Use something you can line with newspaper and seal with a lid to manage odours. </p>

						<div class="detail-answer">
							<p>There is not a regulation about using food grinders and similar technologies. But this information might help you make choices about how you dispose of your food scraps.</p>
	
							<p>In terms of environmental impact, composting is a preferable option.</p>
							<!-- Unordered bulleted list -->
							<ul>
								<li>Food grinders and similar technologies result in food waste in the sewer system where it puts extra pressure on wastewater treatment plants. Sewer water is treated before being released into the environment, and it is costly to treat large volumes of food at the sewage plants.</li>
								<li>Food grinders and similar technologies use a lot of drinking water to move food down your pipes, and through city pipes to the wastewater treatment plants. There are so many better uses for our drinking water.</li>
								<li>Food scraps can be turned into something useful if they are recycled. The resulting compost is used in landscaping, and biofuels are used as a green alternative to fossil fuels.</li>
								
	
								<li>Food grinders and similar technologies can’t take all of your food scraps, for example:
								Bones and large volumes of starch (like rice) clog pipes as they dry.</li>
								<li>Grease should never be poured in the drain as it clogs when it cools, joins up with other solids and can cause overflows in your home. Solidified grease should go in your food scraps bin.</li>
								<li>Food-soiled paper such as pizza boxes, paper towels and napkins can go in your food scraps bin, but not down your food grinder and similar technologies.</li>

							<!-- Answer -->
						<div class="detail-answer">
							<p>Pests and odour can be kept to a minimum with regular emptying and cleaning of food waste containers.  An average building’s garbage is already currently 40% food scraps. Now, those same food scraps are in a separate bin.</p>

							<p>Residents can line their kitchen catchers with newspaper and wrap greasy or wet food scraps in newspaper to absorb moisture, which will reduce odours and prevent flies. Some buildings keep the newspaper recycling near the food scraps bins for this purpose.</p>

							<p>Talk to your hauler about options such as:</p>
							<!-- Unordered bulleted list -->
							<ul>
								<li>Switching in clean bins after collection.</li>
								<li>Using a bin liner approved by the food scraps recycling facility when available.</li>
								<li>Having bins cleaned at time of collection.</li>
								<li>More frequent collection during hot weather.</li>

							<p>Plastics, including those marked biodegradable, and similar items contaminate compost and reduce its value – please keep them out of the green bin. These bags often do not compost properly during processing.</p> 

							<p>The food scraps recycling process makes a high quality product and plastics will contaminate it and reduce its value.</p>

							<p>If non-compostable material is included in the green bin, two things likely occur:</p>
							<!-- Ordered/Numbered List -->
							<ol>
								<li>If identified, the entire load may be rejected and sent to landfill.</li> 
								<li>If not identified, the load may be processed, but the resulting compost will not be usable because it has plastic bits throughout and is not valued for landscaping.</li>
								<li>It is very difficult for staff at the processing plant to determine how plastics are labelled once loads are mixed together and piled at the processing site </li>
							</ol>
							<p>Other common contaminants include: plastic wrap and bags, elastics, twist ties, straws, swizzle sticks, plastic cutlery and glass. </p>

							<p>Line your kitchen catchers with newspaper, paper towels or brown kraft paper bags and wash them out after each use.</p>

							<!-- Answer -->
							<p>Focus on why a resident should participate. When asked, most people care about the place they live, and want to do what they can to help the environment. </p>

							<p>Recycling food scraps does these things:</p>

								<!-- Unordered Bulleted List -->
								<ul>
									<li>Reduces our reliance on landfills. Currently about 40% of the garbage we landfill is food scraps.</li>
									<li>Once buried in the landfill without access to oxygen, food scraps decompose poorly, and create methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Sending them to a processing facility, or using a proper composter however, creates compost for landscaping, or biofuel and energy.</li>
									<li>Helps individuals realize how much food we waste (30 to 60% of a resident’s household garbage is food scraps, ask yourself why?) which can lead to smarter shopping and saving money. </li>
									<li>Can save money for the strata or building manager. The tipping fee on food scraps is lower than the tipping fee for garbage. This means it costs less to dispose of food scraps once they are separated from regular garbage than to leave them mixed together.</li>
									<li>With the new organics disposal ban, garbage loads that contain too much food scraps will receive surcharges on the disposal tipping fee. This may affect the cost of the building’s garbage hauling service.</li>
