						<div class="detail-answer">
							<p>From your answers, we create a quiz profile for you. This includes information about your answers like which genres of books, authors, or themes you already enjoy, what kinds of teas you already drink, or how adventurous you are.</p> 

							<p>Our team of book lovers and tea experts are in touch with what is up-and-coming, what is popular, and what a lot of people might not know about. They bring together your quiz profile and their research to create the perfect combination of products that suit your tastes.</p>

							<p>Although we keep the exact science behind our product selections a secret, here's what we <em>can</em> tell you about our curators:</p>
							<!-- Ordered/Numbered List -->
							<ol>
								<li>They are experts. No one eats up a book or tastes a cup of tea like our people do.</li>
								<li>They receive T&amp;T boxes every month, too.</li>
								<li>They come from all across the globe, bringing us the best of the best.</li>
							</ol>
